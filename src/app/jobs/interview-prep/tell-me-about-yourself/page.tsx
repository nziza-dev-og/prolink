            The question "Tell me about yourself?" is often one of the first questions you'll hear in an interview. It's a common icebreaker, but it's also a crucial opportunity to make a strong first impression and set the tone for the rest of the conversation.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Why Interviewers Ask This</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>To ease into the interview and get a sense of your communication style.</li>
              <li>To understand your background and how it relates to the role.</li>
              <li>To see how you perceive your own strengths and career trajectory.</li>
              <li>To gauge your professionalism and confidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">How to Structure Your Answer</h3>
            <p>
              A good approach is to follow a "Present-Past-Future" model or a "Relevant Skills & Experience" model. Aim for an answer that is about 1-2 minutes long.
            </p>
            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">1. Present:</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>Start with your current role or most recent significant experience.</li>
              <li>Briefly describe your key responsibilities and one or two major accomplishments.</li>
              <li>Tailor this to be relevant to the job you're interviewing for.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
              Example: "Currently, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Tech Solutions, where I specialize in developing and maintaining scalable front-end applications using React and TypeScript. In my recent project, I led a team to redesign our main dashboard, which resulted in a 20% improvement in user engagement."
            </p>

            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">2. Past:</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>Briefly mention previous experiences that have equipped you with relevant skills for this role.</li>
              <li>Focus on experiences that demonstrate your growth and capabilities.</li>
              <li>Avoid a chronological recital of your entire resume. Pick highlights.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
              Example: "Before Tech Solutions, I worked at Innovate Startups, where I honed my skills in agile development and full-stack development, contributing to the launch of two successful products from ideation to deployment."
            </p>

            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">3. Future:</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>Connect your past and present to your future aspirations, specifically why you are interested in *this* role and *this* company.</li>
              <li>Show enthusiasm and how this position aligns with your career goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="italic text-muted-foreground">
              Example: "I'm really excited about this opportunity at [Company Name] because [mention something specific about the role or company, e.g., your innovative approach to X, the chance to work on Y project]. I'm looking to leverage my expertise in front-end development and leadership to contribute to a forward-thinking team like yours."
